# Mathematics behind Malthusian Population Growth

The model contains some key principles:
- Exponential growth: Population grows geometrically.
- Resource constraints: Food supply grows arithmetically.
- Population carsh: Overshoot leads to famine/disease when population exeeds carrying capacity.

## Mathematical model
### Malthusian Growth Equation:
$$\frac{dp}{dt} = rp \left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)$$

Where:
- $P$ = Population size
- $r$ = Intrinsic growth rate
- $K$ = Carrying capacity
- $t$ = Time

- Equilibrium: when $P = K$, population stablizes at subsistence.

### Wage Determination:
$$w = \alpha \cdot \frac{\text{Land}}{L}$$
